#### 1. image processsing 

it applies different filters on the image provided and the ouput file is the result of the particular filter application.
There are four different filters available:
- grayscale
- reflection
- blur
- edges which uses Sobel operator

#### 1. line coordinates

Builds a model which predicts the start and end coordinates of a black line on a white background. This is computer vision model, so it uses only the
images of the line in JPG format for predictions.
TO build the model the following Python libraries were used:
- Keras
- Pillow
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
